# Quora-Incognito
I recommend you sign-up and log-in to access Quora, and keep contributing to this awesome knowledge-sharing platform. However, if you want to access Quora without sign-up and log-in then here is a chrome-plugin for you. This plugin basically hides the sign-up and log-in popup, so that you can browse Quora uninterrupted.
